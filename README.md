 - stack.py: Stack implemented with a singly linked list
 - mergesort.py: Merge sort
 - quicksort.py: Quick sort
 - graph.py: Unweighted, undirected graph implementation
 - tests.py: Tests for the above algorithms and data structures

 - TODO: weighted, directed graphs with inheritence, topological sort, back edge detection, dijkstras
